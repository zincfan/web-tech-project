University project to create a website
This is a project to create a website.
What this website does is just like github hosts repositories. But with additional features
Features are:
A profile page can have resume (as you see in linkedin)
Recruiters can send invitation for conversation with someone if they want to hire or looking to hire.

""Suggestions for adding features are welcomed. These are not only features to be added. We will see about these as progress is made.""

As of 26 Oct 2019 , no webpages are fully fledged. Just prototypes.
